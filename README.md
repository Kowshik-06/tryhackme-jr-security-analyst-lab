# 🛡️ TryHackMe – Jr Security Analyst Intro

This project is based on the TryHackMe room **"Jr Security Analyst Intro"** which gave me a realistic understanding of what a Junior Security Analyst does in a SOC (Security Operations Center).

---

## 👨‍💻 What I Did

- Reviewed simulated **security alerts** and **tickets**  
- Investigated **login logs** to detect brute-force activity  
- Analyzed **email headers** to identify phishing attempts  
- Checked **malware hashes** on VirusTotal  
- Documented all findings with screenshots

---

## 🔍 What I Learned

- How to handle alerts as a Tier 1 SOC analyst  
- How to identify threats using log data, emails, and file hashes  
- Basics of **detection, analysis, triage**, and **incident response**  
- The mindset needed for a future role in **DFIR (Digital Forensics & Incident Response)**
